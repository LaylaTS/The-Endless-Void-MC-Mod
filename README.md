# The-Endless-Void-MC-Mod
IDK we now have a github which is kinda cool i guess i think i am pretty sure

# What even is this about?
Hobby project that is basically an mmorpg in minecraft.
I am trying to rework base game mechanics.

# Why Bedrock?
- official modding API
- mods downloaded when joining the server
- well better perfomance
- allows people from more than 1 platform
- we gonna compete with hypixel or what?
- no 1.9 joke pvp
